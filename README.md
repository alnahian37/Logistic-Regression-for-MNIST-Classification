# Logistic-Regression-for-MNIST-Classification
In this repo, our goal is to implement techniques to learn a multi-class
logistic regressor for performing image digit classification. The modified MNIST dataset has been
used as the training and testing dataset. The classifier will take an image of a hand-written
numerical digit between 1 and 5 as input and classify it into one of 5 classes corresponding to
digit 1 to 5 respectively.
